# DDD & Clean Architecture — A Progressive Learning Repository

> **Compare five implementations of the same business domain, each showcasing a different level of architectural maturity — from naïve CRUD to full Domain-Driven Design with the Mediator pattern.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is **educational material** aimed at developers from intern level to mid/medior level. It answers the question:

*"What does it actually look like when you evolve a codebase from simple CRUD toward Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design?"*

Rather than describing these concepts in theory, we build the **exact same Retrospective Board application** five times — each time applying a more sophisticated design approach. Every API has the same REST contract and is verified by the same integration test suite, making side-by-side comparison straightforward.

---

## 📋 The Domain

We model a **Retrospective Board** tool (think: a simplified retro app for agile teams).

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **User** | A person who can be assigned to projects |
| **Project** | Groups users together; a project can have multiple retro boards |
| **RetroBoard** | A single retrospective session with columns |
| **Column** | A category on the board (e.g., "What went well", "Action items") |
| **Note** | A sticky note placed in a column |
| **Vote** | A user's vote on a note |

### Business Rules (Invariants)

- Column names within a retro board must be **unique**.
- Note text within a column must be **unique**.
- A user may cast only **one vote per note**.
- Only users assigned to a project may participate in its retros.

## 🏗️ The Five APIs

Each API implements the same domain and exposes the same REST endpoints, but with progressively better architecture:

### API 1 — Anemic CRUD
> *"This is what you frequently encounter from juniors."*

- **Pattern:** Table → Entity → Repository → Service → Controller (1-to-1)
- **Business logic lives in:** Service layer
- **Domain models:** Anemic (property bags with public setters, no behavior)
- **Concurrency:** None — last write wins silently
- **Key lesson:** This works for small apps but scatters business rules across multiple services and has no protection against race conditions.

### API 2 — Rich Domain Models
> *"Same structure, but push logic into the entities."*

- **Pattern:** Same Clean Architecture layers as API 1
- **Business logic lives in:** Domain entities (private setters, guard methods, factory constructors)
- **Concurrency:** Still none
- **Key lesson:** Rich domain models centralize invariant enforcement, but without aggregate boundaries the consistency model is still fragile.

### API 3 — Aggregate Design
> *"Introduce consistency boundaries."*

- **Pattern:** Two aggregates — **Project** (owns members) and **RetroBoard** (owns columns → notes → votes)
- **Business logic lives in:** Aggregate roots
- **Concurrency:** Optimistic locking via PostgreSQL's `xmin` column
- **Repositories/Services:** Per-aggregate (not per-entity) — dramatically fewer classes
- **Key lesson:** Aggregates provide a clear consistency boundary, but a large aggregate (RetroBoard with all its children) leads to write contention and expensive loads.

### API 4 — Split Aggregates
> *"Extract Vote as its own aggregate to reduce contention."*

- **Pattern:** Three aggregates — Project, RetroBoard (columns + notes), and **Vote** (standalone)
- **Business logic lives in:** Aggregate roots + cross-aggregate application checks
- **Concurrency:** Optimistic locking per aggregate; DB unique constraints as safety nets
- **Key lesson:** Smaller aggregates improve write scalability but introduce the need for cross-aggregate invariant enforcement and eventual consistency trade-offs.

### API 5 — Behavior-Centric + CQRS + MediatR
> *"Stop thinking in nouns. Think in behaviors. Separate reads from writes."*

- **Pattern:** Commands, Queries, and Domain Events via **MediatR**; **CQRS** separates read and write paths
- **Business logic lives in:** Command handlers + aggregate roots
- **Reads:** Query handlers project directly from the database (no aggregate loading, no change tracking)
- **Writes:** Command handlers load aggregates through repositories, enforce invariants, and persist via UoW
- **Cross-cutting concerns:** Pipeline behaviors (validation, logging, transactions)
- **Domain Events:** Aggregates raise events; handlers react (decoupled side effects)
- **Key lesson:** CQRS eliminates the waste of loading full aggregates for read-only requests. Behavior-centric design scales better for larger teams and feature sets, but adds indirection and a steeper learning curve. This is "CQRS lite" — same database, separated code paths.

## 📊 Tier Comparison

| Aspect | API 1 | API 2 | API 3 | API 4 | API 5 |
|--------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Business logic location | Services | Entities | Aggregate roots | Aggregate roots | Handlers + Domain |
| Repository granularity | Per-table | Per-table | Per-aggregate | Per-aggregate | Per-aggregate |
| Consistency boundary | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ Aggregate | ✅ Aggregate | ✅ Aggregate |
| Optimistic concurrency | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Write contention risk | N/A | N/A | ⚠️ High | ✅ Low | ✅ Low |
| CQRS (read/write split) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Mediator pattern | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Domain events | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The repository uses a **two-layer testing strategy**:

### Domain Unit Tests (API 2–5)

Rich domain entities and aggregate roots are **unit testable without any infrastructure** — no Docker, no database, no HTTP, no mocking. Each test constructs an entity in-memory, calls a method, and asserts the outcome. API 1 is excluded because its anemic entities have no behavior to test.

| Project | What It Tests | Test Count |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| `Api2.Domain.UnitTests` | Entity constructors, guards, invariant methods | ~29 |
| `Api3.Domain.UnitTests` | Aggregate root operations (column/note/vote through RetroBoard) | ~25 |
| `Api4.Domain.UnitTests` | Same as API 3, minus vote (Vote is its own aggregate) | ~23 |
| `Api5.Domain.UnitTests` | Same as API 4, plus domain event assertions | ~29 |

### Integration Tests (All 5 APIs)

All five APIs share the **exact same integration test suite**. Tests run end-to-end: HTTP request → API → PostgreSQL (running in Docker via Testcontainers).

| Test Category | API 1 | API 2 | API 3 | API 4 | API 5 |
|--------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| CRUD happy path | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Invariant enforcement | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Soft delete | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Concurrency conflicts | ❌ Fail | ❌ Fail | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass |
| Consistency under load | ❌ Fail | ❌ Fail | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass | ✅ Pass |

> Concurrency tests are **designed to fail** on API 1 and API 2. This is the point — it makes the value of proper aggregate design tangible.
